    "# Supreme Court Oral Argument Analysis\n",
    "#### The aim of this notebook is to use NLP and Machine learning strategies to see if one can predict how a Supreme Court Justice will vote based on oral arguments, which take place months before a decision.  Justices speak during two distinct sections in a given caseâ€“ one, while the Petitioner (P) is presenting, and two, while the respondent (R) is presenting.  The theory behind the analysis is that Justices speak differently while each side is presenting, because they actually already may know how they will vote, and the language they use in questioning may show such an indication. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "1. This notebook is just a small display of research at the Columbia Law School Programming Lab\n",
    "2. This uses traditional Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVMs) and doesn't use deep learning.  It would be interesting to see how LSTMs would perform.\n",
    "3. This notebook does not use word encodings such as Word2Vec.  Encodings would almost certainly help the predictive performance.\n",
    "3. The dataset contains 215760 utterances from 1128 different cases, before data cleaning (which deletes some bad data).\n",
