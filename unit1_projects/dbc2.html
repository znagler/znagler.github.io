			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nut-Milk-Bag-New-Improved/dp/B00158U8DU"> Nut Milk Bag</a>
					<p> The Nut Milk Bag is basically a giant reusable tea bag, and despite its funny name it is a key purchase for making cold brew </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Mill-Skerton/dp/B001802PIQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1406331180&sr=8-1&keywords=hario+skerton+coffee+grinder"> Hand Coffee Grinder</a>
					<p> Any electronic or manual grinder works, but since you are making cold brew you should embrace the full hipster experience and grind the beans yourself </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/store/coffee"> Full Coffee Beans</a>
					<p> You definitely want to buy full beans and not grounds to get a full flavor, but any type of bean is fine to experiment with.  Counter Culture beans are a good option as the beans are roasted right upon your online order, ensuring freshness.

			<p> <em> Procedure: </em> </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Grind roughly 4 oz. of your beans with a medium or coarse grind.  You should always buy 12 oz. bags, so just aim for about a third of your bag.  Precision is not important since the coffee can always be diluted after brewing if necessary.  This takes 10-15 minutes with a manual grinder.</li>
				<li>Place grounds in the tea bag and fill a plastic pitcher with water.  Tighten the bag, tie a light knot with the string so grounds don't escape, and place the bag in the pitcher.  Cover it up and pop it in the fridge. </li>
				<li> Let the pitcher sit for about 12 hours.  When time is up, remove the bag, and viola, your coffee is ready. </li>
				<li> To serve, pour a small cup with a good amount of ice.  Keep in mind that cold brew is essentially coffee concentrate so it is quite strong in flavor and potency.  It is best served black, so don't even think about adding cream or sugar. </li>
