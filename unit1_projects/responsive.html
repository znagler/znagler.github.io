            Responsive web design is the approach of building sites that adapt to the user's device.  Just a few years ago, companies were content with having two versions of their site--desktop and mobile.  Now, however, screens of all shapes, sizes and resolutions have emerged and exploded, so web designers must cater to this more varied audience.  In practice, it is infeasible to create 5+ versions of a site (for phones, tablets, phablets, netbooks, laptops, desktops, high-res TV's, etc.),  so instead web designers implement certain rules and behaviors to a single site. CSS Media Queries let developers apply these rules to change the very structure of the page depending on the window size, because while wide margins may look nice on a laptop, they waste too much real-estate when viewed on a phone.  As another example, note that the images on this page move from the right side to the center if you make the page narrow.  These techniques are sure to grow and mature in the future, as the evolution of web-friendly devices (smart watch?  Google Glass??) is not slowing down.

            A fluid layout (sometimes called a liquid layout) adjusts to the user's screen resolution by employing percentage widths for the majority of the components. Consequently, columns are relative to one another and the browser--allowing them to scale up or scale down fluidly. The fluid approach can be of benefit because the user-friendliness of sites increase as they are scaled up or down to better fit the end-user's screen resolution and screen size.

            Due to the multitude of screen sizes and resolutions used to access the internet (smart phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc.), contemporary web developers must confront the design challenge of creating cross-browser, cross-device compatible websites. Responsive design and Fluid layouts were devised as a solution for the cross-browser, cross-devise compatibility problem; however, neither approach is a panacea by any means.  As an example, this website employs responsive principles by responding to visitors with smaller screens through media queries, tailoring some of the sites elements for an improved experience. 
            Because the purpose and function of each website is so unique, a particular strategy must be developed to deliver users the website's content in an optimal manner. In practice, this ends up becoming a combination of fluid layouts, with responsive design principles, and corresponding media queries. It is very important to recognize that these are simply tools and it is up to the web designer/developer to choose the right combination of these tools for the particular job at hand.

        Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
        You don't need to keep these questions visible.

        <ul>
            <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
            <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
            <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
            <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 

            The implementation of these concepts at basic level was not too difficult.  Adding more complicated features would take much more research and practice.  Visually impaired people should use tools that magnify the area around the cursor, or the entire screen.  It is also reasonable to have some standards on font sizes.
            The idea of fluid layout paired with CSS media queries makes sense, but it takes practice to use the two in harmony.  One thing that still doesn't make sense to me is the use of pixel lengths.  Since percents are better than pixels, do advanced web designers recommend not using pixel lengths AT ALL, or just very sparingly?
