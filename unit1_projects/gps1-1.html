        <p>Peer pairing is the idea of two people working together
        on a single program or project.  Typically one person
        navigates, meaning that they say exactly what to type, and the
        other person drives, or does the typing. These roles can be
        taken very strictly or more loosely. Often times both programmers
        are changing roles and sometimes stepping out of their assigned
        role to make suggestions.
        </p><p>A crucial part of pair prograaming is communication.
        Both parties need to be in agreement about their end goals and 
        they need to be willing to ask questions and explain their reasoning
        so that both are comfortable about the direction the project is
        taking.

            Why is it important?

        <p>Peer pairing is a great tool for programmers.  It allows
        each party to learn the tricks and strategies that the
        other has picked up. This is especially important in DBC
        where there is so much material to cover. Learning from your
        peers is a great way to absorb concepts. It also simulates a 
        real workplace, because a large component of software developing 
        is reading and reviewing other people's code.</p> 
        <p>Peer pairing is surprisingly
        efficient.  Since there is somebody working with you,
        you stay focused on the task and don't daze off.  It
        allows for live debugging, and is also overall more
        enjoyable.</p>

            What are the challenges?

        <p>Although peer pairing has many benefits it does
        pose a few challenges. First of all are the technical
        challenges. This is true only of remote pairing, like
        we are doing in phase 0. Technical challenges include
        scheduling time when both people are available, using
        platforms like stypi that are occasionaly fussy and
        have to deal with last minute loss of internet connections.
        </p><p>Even in face-to-face pairing, there can still be 
        challenges. Not everyone works well together and part
        of being a good pair is being willing to listen to your 
        peer and respect their opinions and input. You need to
        be able to work well with others. This is true even beyond
        one person being a jerk. Sometimes people just have different 
        working styles or thinking styles. Despite the challenges
        peer pairing is an essential part of programming.
