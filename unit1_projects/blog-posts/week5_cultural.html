					<h2> Pairing Programming Experience </h2>

					<p>
						n my previous pair session, our pair and I had different levels of understanding of the problem and different ideas of how to attack it.  Each of us wanted to experiment with our idea but neither of us were sure we had the best solution.  We noticed this, and realized the best thing to do at that moment was to explore individually for a short period of time, and regroup afterward.  
					</p>
					<p>
						This ended up working well because in the end we each got the benefit of hearing and seeing a fully-fleshed-out idea.  I believe pair programming works best in moments like this-- where each person is flexible regarding working style, aware of how the other person is feeling, and communicative about what strategies seem best.
