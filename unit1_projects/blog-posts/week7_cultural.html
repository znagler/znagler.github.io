						I selected the value <em>independence</em> as an idea that has given me proud moments in life.  After college, I opted to move to Spain for year and half to teach English and learn Spanish.  I didn't know anyone there, and my Spanish was not great going in, but it ended up being an eye-opening and exciting period of my life.  I think I grew as a person from stepping outside my comfort zone and I hope I will be saying the same thing in a few years, about the new path I have chosen.
