					<h2> Relative vs. Absolute vs. Fixed Positions </h2>

 					<p>
						Relative vs. Absolute vs. Fixed positioning is a distinction that takes some thought and practice to understand.  In my own research, I struggled to wrap my head around it until I had read two or three articles, watched Youtube videos, and experimented on my own.<br>

					</p>

					<p>
						The plus side is, implementation is easy.  Just add the property as below to your CSS sheet, and swap out 'relative' for 'absolute' or 'fixed'.  Now the fun part... 
					</p>

					<h3>Fixed:</h3>


					<p>
						Fixed is not the most common position, but it is perhaps the easiest to understand.  It means completely fixed in the browser window. For example, on Facebook, there is a bar across the top that contains the Facebook logo, a search bar, a link to your own profile and few other tools.  You have probably noticed that this bar never moves as you scroll the page down-- it almost looks like the the bar is attached to your browser's toolbar.  Fixed items are just that, essentially locked in place with the browser window itself.  As another example, note the fixed image on the back of this very page.
					</p>

					<h3>Relative:</h3>

					<p>

						Relative means relative to the normal flow of the document.  When you assign a position of relative, you can move objects around from their default placement using top, bottom, left and right properties.  Top will add 'space' to the top, left adds space to the left, etc,.  Thus, your object will actually move the opposite of the written direction, since adding space in one direction equates to moving the object in the opoosite.  <br><br>For exmaple, after the HTML of these paragraphs, there is a green div with position:relative.  The 'bottom' property is set as 0, which does nothing (moving it up 0 pixels) and right is set at 50, moving it left 50 pixels.  That's why you see the box is just a bit left of the default position (which would be below the paragraphs on the left side).
					</p>

					<h3>Absolute:</h3>
					<p>

						Just as with relative positioning, with absolute, we can move objects wherever we want with top, bottom etc., but now they act a bit differently.  With absolute, an object moves relative to its parent, instead of 'relative to itself'.  So with the <em> same HTML and CSS as the position:relative box</em> (besides color of course), the orange position:absolute box is in a totally different place.  The 'bottom: 0px,' which before did nothing, is now telling the box to put 0 pixels of space between the object and the bottom of its parent. Its parent is the large white cloud, so as desired, the orange square has 0 pixels of space on the bottom relative to the cloud.  Similarly, the 'right 50' moves it 50 pixels away from right side of the cloud.<br><br>

						An important detail is that objects with this property are absolutely positioned within their first relatively position parent.  If the parent of absolute object is not relative, the object will probably not behave as desired.  It will, in fact, position relatively to the first ancestor it can find with a relative position, and if there are none, it positions relative to the html tag itself.  Since in this case, the white cloud is position:relative, there's no issue, but it is something that must be considered when using absolute positioning!
