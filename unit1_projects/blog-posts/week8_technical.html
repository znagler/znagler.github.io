					<h2> Regex </h2>
					<p>Regex is a language used for selecting and modifying text.  It uses a series of operators to be able to perform very specific and complex searches.  It is most often used in conjunction with some other language, and luckily, it is built into common ones like Javascript and Ruby.</p>
					<p>To try it in IRB, simply type in a string and call the scan method, and the Regex will go in the argument.  For example, we could have <em>"apple".scan(/ap/)</em>.  This is going to look through the word apple, and try to find 'ap,' and if it does, it will return it.  If it doesn't, it returns an empty array, and if it finds it twice it will return it twice.</p>
					<p> Regex uses special characters like <em>.</em> , <em>*</em> , <em>+</em> and many more to allow for different types of searches.  A period, for exmaple, means one of any character, so if I searched on the string <em>"the cute cat in the cottage"</em> for <em>/c.t/</em>, the returning array would be <em>["cut","cat","cot"]</em> since all those strings match.

					<p>  A few real-world applications of Regex are finding valid addresses and phone numbers, finding (and maybe swapping) certain text in the HTML of a page, URL and search term parsing, and being able to understand <a href="http://www.devclothes.com/shop/images/D/Phone-Digits.jpg" class="inpar">this</a> t-shirt.
