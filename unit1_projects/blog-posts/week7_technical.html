					<h2> SQL injection </h2>

						<h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p>  SQL Injection is a type of attack that intends to uncover private data from SQL-managed databases.  An attacker enters crafted SQL commands into normal site input fields like a username box.  Since SQL manages the data request from those boxes, it will respond to SQL code if nothing is put in place to prevent it.  Depending on the level of vulnerability, an attacker can write SQL code to uncover a password for a given user, or worse, reveal an entire database of user information. 
						</p>

						<h3>Why is it a problem?</h3>
						<p>  It's not hard to find examples, even <a href="http://www.scmagazine.com/racing-post-website-sql-injection-attack-compromises-677k-accounts/article/368541/" class="inpar"> recent ones </a>, of sites compromising private user data from a SQL injection attack.  While there is debate in the security community about whether SQL injection is among the most harmful software erros of today, it is unquestionably a significant problem, and one that may continue to grow as more businesses offer website interaction.
						</p>

						
						<h3>How to deal with it</h3>
						<p> To prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities in your code there are many best practices.  You can use input validation to check length, type and syntax of user inputs.  You can also use prepared, parameterized SQL statements to not allow a full custom statement to be written in a field box.  More detailed methods can be found <a href ="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet" class="inpar">here</a>.
