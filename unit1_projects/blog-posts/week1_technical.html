		<h2> Three good site designs </h2>
		<div id="fivethirtyeight" style="height:175px">

			<a class="domain_name" href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com"> fivethirtyeight.com </a> 			
			<a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com"> 
				<img id="538photo" src="images/538.png" style="float: left; margin-right:10px"/ height="175" width="175">
			</a> 
			<p>
			FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism site that spawned from statistician Nate Silver's blog.  The site focuses on politics, economics, science and sports but will make arguments about any topic, as long as the arguments are intriguing and the topics are current. The articles are consistently backed by solid data and logic.
			</p>
			<p>
			As for the page layout, there is always a large photo for the cover story on the left to draw readers in, and a long-term series infographic on the right, such as a <a id="worldcup" href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/world-cup/"> <u>World Cup predictor</u></a>.  The elegant infographics are what make the site such an engaging experience-- they use hovers to provide a huge amount of information, while maintaining lot of white space.

		</div>
		<div id="duolingo" style="height:175px">
			<a class="domain_name" href="http://www.duolingo.com"> duolingo.com </a> 
			<a href="http://www.duolingo.com"> 
				<img id="duolingophoto" src="images/duolingo.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left:10px" height="175" width="175"/>
			</a> 
			<p> Duolingo is a language-learning platform.  It offers dynamic lessons which change depending on your success of previous questions, and question types are constantly rotating between speaking, direct translation, conjugation, and others. </p>
			<p>  With regard to design, Duolingo has a playful theme.  The divisions all have soft, rounded edges and the fonts are large and colorful.  This makes the experience feel like a kids game and dispels some of the intimidation that typically comes from beginning a new language.  Similar to Khan Academy, it also offers  reward tokens for completing exercises to motivate users to carry on.  
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="wolfram" style="height:175px">
			<a class="domain_name" href="http://www.wolframalpha.com"> wolframalpha.com </a> 
			<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">
				<img id="wolframphoto" src="images/wolfram.png" style="float: left; margin-right:10px" height="175" width="175"/>
			</a> 
			<p> Wolfram, the computational knowledge engine, may not boast a cute animal logo like the two above, but it is still a triumph of good design.  Like Google, Wolfram Alpha needs input from the user in order to be useful. For that reason, it doesn't attempt to distract or complicate the experience of its homepage, and provides only a search bar and a ton of whitespace (again, like Google).  </p>
			<p>  The page does contain a beautiful interactive collage of image links which blends subtly into the lower part of the page.  This has the effect of providing countless ideas for a curious or bored user without distracting users who already know what they want.
