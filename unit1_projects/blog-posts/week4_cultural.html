					<h2> Monopolies in Tech </h2>
 					<p>
						When I tried to get internet at my apartment last year, Comcast informed me that it was impossible because the address already had a registered account.  On the phone call we determined that the previous tenant forgot to close their account, and Comcast said they would contact him, but if he didn't reply there was nothing they could do.  To me, this seemed a bit ridiculous since I could prove I was the resident of the address, but OK.  I called Comcast several times in the following days, each time waiting 20 minutes to actually speak to a person of course, and nothing changed.  Finally, after about a week, I got a call from Comcast while at work, and the rep said, "Congratulations, the address is open now so you can get service." 
					</p>
					<p>
						So, frustrated by the delay but finally happy that the ordeal was over, I called back that night to set up my service.  Just before settling the sale, the rep said, "Actually, sir, I'm sorry but I can't connect you because I am seeing that somebody else is registered at your address."  Confused, I informed the rep of the story of the last week and in particular, the call from that morning.  Not surprisingly, he had no record of the call, and was still seeing the address registered and couldn't help me.


					</p>

					<p> At this point I wasn't totally thrilled with my Comcast customer service experience. Luckily, we live in a functioning capitalist society,  so at that point I simply called one of Comcast's competitors and happily got service through them.  Wait, no, actually, there were no other internet service providers for my neighborhood.   With no other option, I waited another few weeks until finally the old tenant closed his account, and then started paying my favorite telecom company every month.
					</p>

					<p> Overall, I was really thankful Comcast had been so helpful, responsive and coordinated.  I also really enjoyed the unsolicited phone calls every month or so asking me to upgrade to faster service or packages with landlines (because these days, everyone really needs a landline).  Great work Comcast, what a delight!
