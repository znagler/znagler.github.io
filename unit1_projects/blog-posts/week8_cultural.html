						While working at my data analyst job, I had a conflict with a project lead.  She was essentially my boss for the project but was new at the company, and I don't think the team (myself included) acted appropriately given her tenure.  She didn't give me the specs for a project I needed, so I had to ask every small detail from her when normally it is the project lead's job to say what is needed, not just field a bunch of questions.</p>
						<p>  It turned out that a couple weeks later, after some lengthy data processing, that one of the project inputs was incorrectly set up by me because she had never told me otherwise, and my set-up was basically the default.  This required a large portion of the project to be re-run and re-processed, and the deliverable was late as a result and I felt that I was mostly blamed, which I resented.
						</p>
						<p> Looking back, I feel like I was put in a tough position but I should have stepped up and escalated the early problems I was noticing at an early stage.  It's always easier to go with the flow, but if something really seems to be going wrong, it ends up causing less stress to deal with it head-on and early on.
