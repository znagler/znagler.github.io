					<h2> Why JavaScript?</h2>
 					<p>
						Despite its complicated history and lifetime of being confused with Java, the lightweight, object-oriented language JavaScript has emerged as the universally-used programming language for the Web.  <br>

					</p>

					<p>
						JavaScript is most commonly known as the language that builds the highly interactive applications we all love on the Web, but its reach extends far beyond browsers.  JavaScript is also used on:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Operating Systems</li>
						<li>Databasaes</li>
						<li>Servers</li>
						<li>Mobile Devices</li>
						<li>Televisions and other electronics</li>
					</ul>
					<hr>
					<h3>Pros:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>One of the only reliable ways to do client-side Web programming</li>
						<li>Since it runs client-side, it reduces load on servers which is key for high-traffic sites</li>
						<li>Can be inserted into any Web page regardless of file extension</li>
						<li>Relatively easy to learn, using common-sense English words and sharing syntax with other popular languages</li>
						<li>Interpreted, not compiled</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Cons:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Rendering can vary between browsers</li>
						<li>Vulnerable to some security issues</li>
						<li>Client must enable JavaScript</li>
					</ul>

					<hr>
					<p> While JavaScript has its weaknesses, its future looks bright because of the increasing demand for applications of all types to run on browsers and mobile devices.  Since the server sides is also now embracing JavaScript with tools like Node.js, JavaScript is one of the most useful languages a programmer can learn, and will stay that way for at least the near future.
