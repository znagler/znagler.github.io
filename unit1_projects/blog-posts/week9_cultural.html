					<p>One of the most important things about posting a question
						is that it not be something readily available on Google.
						If literally typing your question into Google gets you
						a good answer people won't see it worth it to reply.
						Next, be specific about what you are trying to do and
						what you have already tried.  Make it quick since long posts
						tend to be ignored.  Aside from those ides, be sure to
						say thanks at the end of the post and be responsive
						to anyone who is nice enough to help out.
