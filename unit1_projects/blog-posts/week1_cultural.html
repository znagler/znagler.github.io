		<h2> DBC Fireside Chat Impression</h2>

				<em>DBC has a large focus on empathy and soft skills</em><br>
				<p class="impression">
					I am keeping an open-mind about these ideas, but my initial reaction was skepticism.  Web programming is such an mammoth field, with countless subfields and related concepts, that to say the best programmers are those who have emotional intelligence as opposed to deep and thorough knowledge seems debatable.  I will say, however, that frustration and lack of patience have been the principle causes for me not achieving goals in any given life challenge, so if emotionally intelligent people can harness those emotions, they will be more likely to succeed.  
				</p>
				<em>Programming is a team sport</em><br>

				<p class="impression">
					Since I worked in an analyst/programmer role for a year and a half I know this is true, and I hope it remains true in software dev positions.  It makes sense to me that reading and team-revising other people's code is common, as to ensure best practices are maintained.  Also, businesses have incentives in improving their developers' skills, and team feedback is a key component of that growth.

				</p>
				<em>The curriculum is front-loaded</em> <br>
				<p class="impression">
					It was satisfying to hear Shereef say this because more than anything, my initial feeling while working through week 1 challenges is overwhelmed.  Since I feel comfortable with basic Ruby, I didn't anticipate a huge struggle on week 1, but little did I know week 1 topics would be completely different.

					In the grand scheme of things, this struggle will be a good.  There's no way to truly learn HTML and CSS without putting in many hours of work and experimentation.  It's exciting that because of the front-loaded curriculum, we will already have a solid knowledge base before Phase 1 begins.
