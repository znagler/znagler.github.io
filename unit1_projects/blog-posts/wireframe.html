		<h1> Wireframe Analysis of Three Pages </h1>

		<div id="main">

			<ul>
				<em>fivethirtyeight.com homepage</em><br>
				<p class="impression">
					News sites have to strike a delicate balance.  They want to put a lot of content on the front page to increase chances that a user at random will see something that interests him or her.  If there is too much content, however, the page will look cluttered.<br>
					Fivethirtyeight does a good job of only showing a few articles on the front page, but having each one pack a punch-- the cover story on the left and the infographic on the right are usually topics of universal appeal.

				<em>duolingo.com lesson page</em><br>

				<p class="impression">
					The lesson page is the most critical page of a teaching site.  In the case of Duolingo, the page only shows one question at a time, freeing the user from distractions.  There is also a clear progress bar that fills up a notch for each question answered, and resources such as "Tips and Notes" are readily available directly above the question.

				<em>wolframalpha.com homepage</em> <br>
				<p class="impression">
					Wolfram Alpha's wireframe design directs all attention to the center search bar.  Outside the search box, the page is virtually all whitespace, with the only exception being a small bar along the top for sign-in.  This design works well for the page because the function of the site is to calculate or compute the ouput for a provided user input.
