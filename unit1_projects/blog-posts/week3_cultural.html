					<h2> Thinking Style </h2>
 					<p>
						My Gregorc thinking style is <em> abstract sequential </em>, but so what?  Ideally, knowing this will allow me to leverage my strengths and recognize and account for weaknesses. 
					</p>

					<p> Abstract thinkers have a strong ability to visualize and conceive ideas, and use intuition.  These tools are hugely important in programming.  If you can't visualize some sort of end result of a web page, you can't manage the details as you build it out.  A downside of this, which I have already experienced, is that it can be extra frustrating if the idea that you have visualized won't work the way you want it to.
					</p>

					<p> Sequential thinkers organize information in a linear manner.  This should help me make and stick to an agenda for learning and prevent me from getting caught up in rabbit holes.  While this will be good for allowing me to learn the required topics, the negative side is that I may avoid the random exploration that can lead to interesting discoveries.  For that reason, if I am not behind on time I think I should encourage myself to read up on and test tangential topics if they pique my interest.
