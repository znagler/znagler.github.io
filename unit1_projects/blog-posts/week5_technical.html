					<h2> Classes </h2>

						<p>Classes are a data structure found in many programming languages.  They allow for creation of several instances of object, all of which share certain attributes.</p>

						<p>  It's helpful to theink about two pieces of an object-- things the object knows and things the object does.  As an example, consider the class snowboard.  Any given snowboard has some info, such as brand, and length.  These are things the object knows.  Snowboards can also do things, such as move or jump.
						</p>

						<p>
							The things that the snowboard knows, in this case the brand and length, must be provided when creating the snowboard object.  After that point, they are stored in instance variables, meaning that object will always be able to access that information.
						</p>
						<p>
							The thing the object does, such as jump, is a method.  Since the method is written inside the snowboard class, any snowboard object will be able to perform it.  This is no different than any other method you have used-- All methods are built to work on a certain class, whether it be a built in class such as string or homemade class like snowboard.
