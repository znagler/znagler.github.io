					<h2> Stereotype Threat </h2>

					<p>
						According to social psychologist Dr. Claude Steele, Stereotype Threat is the fear that individuals can feel of confirming a negative sterotype about a group of people that they belong to.  The group category is not limited to just race or gender, since factors like age, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and others cause the same effects.  The threat of confirming a stereotype can almost be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  As Steele says, "If you care about what you are doing, the prospect of being judged is upsetting and distressing and disturbing. In a situation like this, it takes cognitive resources away from a relaxed engagement with the task at hand and that undermines your performance."  
					</p>
					<p>
						To reduce the harm of stereotype, a good method is to modify task descriptions so those stereotypes are not invoked by using language that doesn't highlight social identities.  Additionally, actively 'disarming' the stereotype can be effective.  Gender Stereotypes, for example, can be reduced by ensuring females that the test is gender-fair.
